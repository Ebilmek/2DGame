Change Log
v1.0 - Initial Plan (in before even looking at what SDL can do, so will change once ENGINECORE is being/is implemented)

Target game: Some basic tower defence with decent pathfinding (recalculations on maze changes) menus 
(some decent settings (screen resize, frame rate?, brightness? etc.)) 
maybe some highscores (requires external file editing).

File plan?
